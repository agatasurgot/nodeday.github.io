                                    In this talk, Jean-Charles will talk about where PayPal is on their journey of adopting Node.js. With a couple of years of exploration and experimentation behind them, PayPal has exited the honeymoon phase and has had to address the real problems that come with expanding a technology to hundreds of engineers around the world. Hear what has worked, what hasn't, and how embracing open source has kept it all together.

                                        <b>Abstract</b>
                                        With Node.js reaching enterprise maturity, adoption means engineers must be prepared to re-platform existing code and infrastructure. In an enterprise setting, the question shifts from "Is Node enterprise ready" to "Are you, as an organization or team, Node.js ready?" This talk will share one engineer's experiences with this process, from successes to obstacles in the enterprise. Apurva will share her lessons learned as an engineer in a team that worked through the challenges as she focuses on 3 main characteristics — Non-blocking I/O model, Server side javascript & module systems.

over the past few years. This talk will dive into three areas:

1. Why "Tooling" is the future of the web?

2. The various choices made by the Flipkart Mobile team in the development-deployment lifecycle of

JavaScript-based applications.

3. The lessons learnt from these choices and best practices around them.

To that effect, we are enabling Node.js to run on all devices running Windows 10 by using the Chakra JavaScript engine, bringing the power of scripting to all Universal apps. In this talk we will discuss how developers could embed the Chakra JavaScript engine in their Universal Windows applications by using the JavaScript Runtime (JSRT) APIs. We will also provide an in-depth look at how we are utilizing these APIs to help Chakra power Node.js on Windows IoT Core, running on low power devices like Raspberry Pi2 and bringing the power of  UWP to Node.js

Some of the early learnings while getting familiar with Node was that it had an incredibly fast bootstrap, a setup that made it easy to prototype and get feedback, simple deployments and a simple continuous integration process. However the challenges faced were two fold, one in the learning curve for various constructs like promises, testing promises, the non blocking paradigm and the second around computation heavy actions having a blocking effect, thus limiting the application severely to I/O operations and also the lack of maturity in the language to support configurations around upper bound limits for memory on a node process.                                                      </p>
