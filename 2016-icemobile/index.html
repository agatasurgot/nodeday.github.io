                            <p>
                              nodeday Amsterdam is a conference that showcases the best and most interesting contributions of the local and international Node.js community: from PayPal to Particle and from NPM to nearForm.
                              <br><br>
                              This one-day event brings together folks from companies that have adopted Node.js and focuses on the experience these groups have had. From issues to successes, our speakers will take you on a journey that starts with "zero" and ends in "production". And we will even show you how to deal with complimentary crashes you might face in the process.
                              <br><br>
                              Fret not: if you have not pulled the trigger on Node.js yet, this event is for you too. Learn from the best and brightest the community has to offer and see why the Node.js approach is different.
                              <br><br>
                              Come and join us on February 11, 2016 at the iconic Machinegebouw for a full-day learning session and ample opportunities to take your skills to the next level.
                              <br><br>
                              <small>Please note: the event is free, however, we are asking you to pay a registration fee, which will be fully refunded the day of the event once youâ€™ve checked in.</small>
